## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
* Git

## Installation

`pip install evo-data-converters-obj`

## OBJ

The OBJ 3D mesh format is a legacy of Wavefront Technologies, but is now a common format for specifying polygon meshes,
optionally with texture data (stored in a separate MTL file).

### Implementations

The Python [Trimesh](https://trimesh.org/index.html) package is used to work with OBJ files by default, for import and export. There are other optional importer implementations such as [TinyOBJ](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader), [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org/) and the VTK library that `evo-data-converters-vtk` provides. These can be installed as an optional extra as `optional_parsers` and then passed as the `implementation` string to `convert_obj()`. Trimesh and TinyOBJ are the preferred implementations for completeness and speed respectively.

### Publish geoscience objects from an OBJ file

[The `evo-sdk-common` Python library](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-data-converters/tree/main/packages/common) can be used to sign in. After successfully signing in, the user can select an organisation, an Evo hub, and a workspace. Use [`evo-objects`](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/tree/main/packages/evo-objects) to get an `ObjectAPIClient`, and [`evo-data-converters-common`](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-data-converters/tree/main/packages/common) to convert your file.

Have a look at the `samples/publish-obj.ipynb` Notebook for an example of how to publish an OBJ (and related) files.

### Export objects to OBJ

To export an object from Evo to an OBJ file, specify the Evo object UUID of the object you want to export and the output file path, and then call `export_obj()`.
See documentation on the `ObjectAPIClient` for listing objects and getting their IDs and versions.

You may also specify the version of this object to export. If not specified, so it will export the latest version.

You will need the same selection of organisation, Evo hub, and workspace that is needed for importing objects.

See the `samples/export-obj.ipynb` Notebook for an example of how to download a Evo Geoscience object to an OBJ.
