class ColumnMapping:
    """
    Configuration for mapping DataFrame columns to downhole collection data structures.

    Provides lists of possible column names for each type of column, allowing matching
    against various input formats. Column matching is case-insensitive.

    **Attributes:**

    - HOLE_INDEX_COLUMNS: Column names for the hole index (1-based integer relating to collar table)
    - DEPTH_COLUMNS: Column names for point measurement depths (used by DistanceTable)
    - FROM_COLUMNS: Column names for interval start depths (used by IntervalTable)
    - TO_COLUMNS: Column names for interval end depths (used by IntervalTable)

    Each attribute contains a list of possible column names to search for.
